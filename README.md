# What's this?

An anonymous chatting application that uses chatgpt.

# Built With

- React
- React Emoji
- Open AI
- Socket IO
- Express

Originally coded by [Adrian Hajdin](https://github.com/adrianhajdin) with modifications made by myself.

I wanted to explore how sockets worked at the time, but recently I added chat gpt to it. You can tag @chattrbot for responses, and everyone can chat with the bot in the chatroom.
